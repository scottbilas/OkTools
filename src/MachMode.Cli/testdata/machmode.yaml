# traits
#
# - valid:   true if this is available to be selected/combined
# - combine: copy the other thing and combine it with this one via add or subtract (is "soft" - the other thing may be invalid in which case it is ignored)
# - require: copy validity requirement of other thing and combine with this (may be "any" or "all" expr)
# - config:  any of these entries, holds rules and state and validity and instructions
# - target config: the final config we are accumulating and will process. user is adding/subtracting to this.

# by default profiles using profiles are required, but we can do a simple combine with ? at the end
# by default profiles using features are combined

# entity: validity is controlled by detecting whether entity is connected/active. usually is a physical device but doesn't need to be. just needs a way to detect it.
# feature: a set of processes and OS services that we can detect/start/stop when feature is activated/deactivated. may require one or more entities to be valid.
# profile: can combine entities and features and other profiles. all features are activated/deactivated along with the profile.
