{0}, the PML processor v{1}

Tools for baking and querying symbols from a Process Monitor Log (PML) file.

Usage:
  {0} bake [--debug] [--no-ntsymbolpath] [--no-symbol-download] PML
  {0} resolve PML
  {0} query PML QUERY...
  {0} convert [--mergethreads=STRATEGY] [--mergeprocs] [--showall] [--include-stacks] PML [CONVERTED]
  {0} help [HELPCMD]
  {0} (-h|--help)
  {0} (-v|--version)

Commands:
  bake       Make a PML file portable by baking native and Mono symbols into <PML>.pmlbaked.
  resolve    Try to resolve symbols for every module found in PML.
  convert    Render file IO events from the PML to CONVERTED in Chrome trace format.
  query      Run basic queries against the given PML file.
  help       Show this screen. Optionally get help for a subcommand.

Arguments:
  PML        Path to the PML (Process Monitor Log) file to process. An extension
             of `.pml` will be added if missing. The folder containing this file
             will also be used for:

             * Finding mono pmip jit log files (copy them here before Unity exits)
             * Writing a .pmlbaked file with the same filename as PML with the
               symbolicated data, to be used for a `query`.

  QUERY      {{int,datetime}} Print the stack for the matching event.
             {{regex}}        Print ID's for events that match symbol or module name.

  CONVERTED  Optional filename for converted PML. If not specified, the
             converted PML will be written to <PML>.json.

Options:
  --debug                  Write PMLBAKED in a more readable text debug format. (3-4x bigger)
  --no-ntsymbolpath        Don't use _NT_SYMBOL_PATH
  --no-symbol-download     Strip any http* from _NT_SYMBOL_PATH to avoid slow downloads

  --mergethreads STRATEGY  Strategy for merging threads, case insensitive. One of:

                           * none: Do not merge threads (same as no --merge-threads)
                           * all:  Merge all threads into a single thread called `(merged)`. This will allow
                                   categorization in the trace view.
                           * min:  Merge threads down to the minimum required to do the IO in parallel

  --mergeprocs             Merge processes with the same name to take the first instance's pid. Useful for reducing
                           noise from multicore subprocesses like lld.exe.

  --showall                Include events that are normally filtered out:

                           * Events with no frames (grep for `rwEvent.Frames == null` in source for more info)
                           * Nested events processing the same file with the same operation
                           * Debug-type events such as writing to the Mono/Unity pmip_* file

  --include-stacks         Include stack traces in the `args` of each event. Will make the file gig@nt0r and possibly
                           Chrome/Edge will fail to load it.

  -v --version             Show version.

IMPORTANT: baking should be done before any DLL's are replaced, such as from a
Windows Update or rebuilding Unity. No validation is done to ensure that DLL's
matching a given path are the exact same as what was recorded into a PML.
