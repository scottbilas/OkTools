# Zodiacon.DebugHelp

This code is originally from https://github.com/zodiacon/DebugHelp

It was targeting .NET Framework and I wanted to migrate it to .NET 6, maybe extend it as needed. Easiest is to just drop it into my project and hack away. 

No license was provided in the source repo, so I'm maintaining credit to @zodiacon in the namespace and assembly attributes.
